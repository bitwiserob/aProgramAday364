About
================================================
The purpose of this repository is to create a small program a day for as long as possible.

Rules
---
1. Program must complete atleast one task.
2. Program must be more complicated then a hello world program or something similar.
3. Program must be completed once a day starting from 2018-01-11

Disclaimer:
---
The programs presented here are quick prototypes usually completed within a few hours. Due to the time constraints associated with making a program everyday, each program only has enough testing to ensure basic functionally. There is also no error handling unless it was essential to the base functionally of the program.  sssd
